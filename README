# Cipher - A Simple Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

This tool is used to encode and decode text using a simple Caesar cipher.

On Linux, BSD, or other *nix variants you can build simply by running `make`.

The code is written in ANSI C with the hope that it can also be used on 
retrocomputers with only a few changes to `main.c`.

The cipher only encodes and decodes captial letter from the English alphabet. 
I realize this is highly limiting, but this is meant to be used for simple 
messages, not for serious encryption.

The current implementation limits the maximum size of the one-time pad to 4KiB 
to save memory on older computers, but this would be an easy thing to change.

file named `LICENSE`.
